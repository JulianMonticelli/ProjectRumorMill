These are a list of names that simulations can use to make random names (based on human names) for nodes instead of the standard "n1" or "1" names which are disgustingly boring.

Credit goes to Deron from http://deron.meranda.us/data/ for providing the precursor files to these lists (although they are in the public domain)
